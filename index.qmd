Hi there! I'm Sammy, an Ecosystem Science & Sustainability Student at Colorado State University. As you can probably tell by my picture, I am a nature enthusiast and love being out in the field! I am looking for positions that would allow me to practice what I've learned in the classroom in a hands-on, professional environment.

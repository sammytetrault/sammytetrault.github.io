This semester at CSU (Spring 2025) I am taking ESS330, Quantitative Reasoning. In this course we are learning to use R and RStudio. We will be using R to do data analysis, as well as other projects, like this website!

Below are links to all of the projects I have completed in this course:

1\) For this project, we created a quarto website and learned how to create a site with Github pages, link websites, and customize the theme. Check out my github linked on the home page to see the repository with all of the code for this.
